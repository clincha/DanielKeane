He writes about the human experience, and emphasizes kindness, friendship and helping each other out in his work. His first book ‘Foxes with Boxes’ is his happiest achievement yet! He is often described as energetic, and a loyal persona. \"I had the idea for the book in my mind for a while, and I have been writing lyrics and poetry since I was 13. I put the idea on my group chat and two of my mates thought I should write it,since it wasn’t a huge word count- I wasn’t intimidated to write it! I found that children’s books were so lovely and warm to write, and it came out naturally out of ten minutes.\"" flipped=true></@bookPageRow>
