                    Daniel Keane is an indie-pop artist from Kent, combining catchy pop melodies, contemporary
                    millennial
                    lyricism, and electronic influences to create a fresh new sound. Born in a dismal conservative
                    Maidstone,
                    Daniel
                    performed behind ‘Bonhomie’ for 5 years, before continuing under a new project ‘Daniel Keane’.
                    Inspired
                    by
                    nightlife,
                    the mental health of others and the struggle of musicianship – the Keane boi was born. Performing
                    throughout
                    the
                    South-East, Daniel Keane + The Anime (performing band) perform a ‘tight, eclectic and memorable set’
                    according to D. Kitchener and C. Austen. Releasing ‘Suburban Ballet’ in early 2019, and with an
                    upcoming
                    EP,
                    there is
                    much more on the way from Daniel Keane and his band...
